# wekanapi

A read-only, standalone API for Wekan. Because why not? And they are busy making the app itself awesome, which doesn't leave any time to work on an API.

Use at your own risk! No security implemented yet.

## Installation

You will notice that, for now, the source tree comes with mongo and bson bindings. It shouldn't, but Crystal has been moving too fast for most library authors. I will submit these patched versions to their owners when I can.

## Usage

Run; curl to URL.
